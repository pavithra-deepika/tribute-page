## Learnt
 - The img tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The img tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
 - The img tag has two required attributes:<br />
    src - Specifies the path to the image
    alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed
 -  The figcaption tag defines a caption for a figure element.
 - The strong tag is used to define text with strong importance. The content inside is typically displayed in bold.
 - The em tag is used to define emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.
